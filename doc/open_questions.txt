1. Only 2 genders? -> boolean
2. What happens if a user submits a finetune job for which the model reference already exists in the db? error or replace?
3. Can the gender of inference be different from the gender of the related finetune job?
4. I think in your tables you are missing a creation date.
5. There are many statuses (finetune job, inference job, aws instance)... statuses are always dangerous and should be avoided. So can you please give me a full list and what they mean.
6. Document the API on swagger?
