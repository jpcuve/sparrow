Only 2 genders? -> boolean
What happens if a user submits a finetune job for which the model reference already exists in the db? error or replace?
Can the gender of inference be different from the gender of the related finetune job?
I think in your tables you are missing a creation date.
There are many statuses (finetune job, inference job, aws instance)... statuses are always dangerous and should be avoided. So can you please give me a full list and what they mean.
